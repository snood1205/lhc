1. `1 + 1` and `2`: They are equivalent expressions
2. `10 ^ 2` and `10 + 9 * 10`. These are also equivalent. `10 + 9 * 10` is equivalent to `10 +
   90` which is the same as `10 ^ 2` as they are both `100`.
3. `400 - 37` is not equivalent to `(-) 37 400`. `(-) 37 400` is equivalent to `37 - 400`
    which is the opposite of `400 - 37`.
4. ``100 `div` 3`` is not the same as `100 / 3`. The first is integral division and will
   return `33` whereas the second is normal division and will return `33.33333333`.
5. `2 * 5 + 18` is not the same as `2 * (5 + 18)` The first is `10 + 18 = 28` whereas the
   second is `2 * 23 = 46`.
